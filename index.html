           <p style="color:black">If you've got lots of money and you're a bit daft, NFTs are a geat way to pay for something that doesn't have any intrinsic value or even exist.
               Tech fashionistas are jumping on the NFT bandwagon and spending eye-watering sums of money on crypto images. Our advice: spend the weekend <a href="index.html">crafting an NFT</a> and by this time next week, you'll be a millionaire.

               Is $300k for sneakers too basic for you? No problem! This CryptoPunk (left) is a steal at $6.6 million! Which
               makes Bag #748 (right) a total bargain at $1.4 million.
               And by the way, that's not a VS Code screenshot we included by mistake. The eight lines of white text on a black
               background is the actual NFT we're selling.
